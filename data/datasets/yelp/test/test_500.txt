the $_num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying.
sorry but i don't get the rave reviews for this place.
the desserts were very bland.
the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry.
it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice.
once again, i haven't figured out why they change so much.
consistently slow.
even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent.
so nasty.
i hate mayonnaise.
my goodness it was so gross.
i can't even handle how gross it was.
went here for the first time to try something new...bad idea.
expensive, lack luster burgers.
would not recommend.
the "chicken" strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips.
the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich.
fries aren't worth coming back.
now the service i experienced was bad.
i ended up here by accident (not a happy accident).
the chicken tenders didn't taste like chicken, wtf?
so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda.
horrible!
crap fries, hard hamburger buns, burger tasted like crap!
i'm so disappointed!
but service was horrible both times.
gross.
the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce.
sorry they closed so many stores.
the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever.
i wanted to like this place so badly.
charging $_num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous.
i just got a plain ole cup of joe.
so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $_num_.
had they informed me of the charge i wouldn't have waited.
that's why they get the score i gave them.
if i could give them a zero star review i would!
however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely.
sorry not my style nor taste.
- oh and terrible tea!
they close earlier than posted hours.
i wish i could give zero stars.
i really really wish i could.
this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses.
you provided none of those services for our $_num_!
that leaves you no excuse.
all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off.
i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses.
how sick.
you don't deserve any animals!
cons: a cockroach problem that hasn't been fixed by the management company.
the interior is old and generally falling apart.
tl; dr version at bottom.
this place is bad news!
still down btw).
quickly found out they like to close for "breaks" all day.
old managers always gave us discounts, but melissa refused.
which was _num_ am, every morning, for weeks.
flat tires everywhere!
worst was when we had to break our lease early.
it was never done.
tl; dr version: sketchy as hell!
if you do, make sure you get everything in writing!
these people will try to screw you over!
okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out.
the last months were the worst.
the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period.
you will find both in your apartment, without fail.
front office: customer service doesn't exist here.
they are clueless.
there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment.
if i could give less than a star, i would.
maintenance is equally incompetent.
mission rock have done none of those things.
about two weeks later, my ac broke (in august!)
this apartment community is horrific!
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here.
i have never had pizza like this in chicago.
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses.
not impressed.
i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained.
village inn, home run inn.
i do not like anybody's pan pizza in phoenix.
not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though.
i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza.
just not for me.
the crust was kinda gooey like.
they were really nice i just can't stand this kind of pizza.
however the atmosphere lacked, mainly because there were no tvs or music playing.
the sauce was way too sweet for my taste.
a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using.
pizzeria bianco - sit down joint.
no delivery option though!
too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back.
i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about.
it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.
the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.
defiantly not my favorite pie.
unfortunately, the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients.
almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce.
the answer was none.
this place sucks.
we have been there _num_ times, with an attempted 3rd time.
1st time, burnt pizza, was horrible.
won't go back.
also like all spinatos they are closed on monday.
the food was bland...if you like spinatos, just avoid this location.
it's not worth it.
friendly staff, but not overly helpful.
we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard.
the pizza sauce is also way too sweet.
it tasted more like a dessert some bites.
too sweet for me, but maybe you're into that?
pretty disappointed it didn't live up to the hype.
the sweet sauce was not that great either.
mozzarella had very little cheese flavor.
over priced, poor value.
first time i had a bad experience here.
server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted.
super annoying to find that out during the meal.
constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down.
really dissapointed won't go back.
however this was a huge disappointment.
italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added.
it was gross.
the flavoring was off.
very disappointing.
unfortunately, our experience did not live up to others' experiences.
bad move!
the italian sausage and peppers, however, were fine.
", check took another _num_ minutes.
they updated their meatball sub and it is awful?
we use to go 1-2 times a week and we haven't been back!
they don't seem to care either.
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake.
may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich.
it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy.
raise the price do not lower the standard of quality.
now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce.
this was not the case.
personally i'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business.
great pizza but no wine or beer!
thats just not italian!
the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes.
and if i go, i'll pay cash and sit at the bar.
i've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year.
to my surprise, they were completely out of wings.
we never want to let a loyal customer down.
no contact what so ever.
bars must be a bad business for making money.
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer.
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it.
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days?
i will miss your patio and cheap, cheap appetizers.
this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor.
my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane.
which is pretty bad since they're not really ones to give negative feedback.
if you're feeling lucky, go check it out.
v is for very, very, extra ordinary.
not extraordinary, kids - just ordinary.
i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places.
i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point.
but wait, what about the broth.
i ordered pho tai: the soup tasted salty, lacked depth i.e.
my pho was terrible.
just got off the plane and needed some lunch.
bottom line: disappointed!
worst experience ever.
customer service was bad.
the restaurant was dark and didn't even turn the lights on.
it wasn't for the mood either, probably to save electric bills.
the water tasted bad, and worst of all, the food tasted horrible.
never going back.
pho tasted bland.
seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it.
it's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe.
terrible service!
i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke.
went back today and the service was even worse.
i walked in and sat down at the only available table.
the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me.
i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins.
eventually, my pho was dropped off at my table.
i seriously don't know how the place manages to pass health inspections.
what a disappointment.
do not, i repeat, do not waste your money at this place.
thankfully i didn't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible.
greasy layer of fatty broth.
pretty much a hole in the wall status but it wasn't good.
the only plus was that the service was decent.
i wouldn't recommend coming here.
i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_!
they only want your money at sea of green.
_num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in.
i hate this place now, and you should too.
what a terrible way to treat a customer.
they had one...but not cheap at all!
the replacement was expensive.
one not so bad time does not make me loyal.
the older man there said it would be $_num_.
$_num_?
that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run.
what a ridiculous thing to say.
very low integrity bike shop.
larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin.
afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal.
"well those walmart bikes are poor quality.
that's why i'm returning the bike."
i (and apparently many other customers on yelp) recommend shopping somewhere else.
this place is garbage!
worst sales experience ever!
edit: after reading more reviews it appears they do this often!
this was hands down the worst sushi i've ever had.
my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside.
my husband's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce.
seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination...crazy fish.
i kinda really wish i'd gone somewhere else.
not so good.
my boyfriend and i went there one night.
it wasn't that the place was busy--far from it.
overall, i would not return to this place.
shouldn't have bothered.
gross.
i placed a to-go order for my sick partner.
and then charged me nine dollars for it.
but salmon and cream cheese is $_num_.
expired in _num_.
sub par sushi (at best) and terrible service!
big mistake.
he never said hello, or even looked us in the eye.
needless to say, we left the restaurant and will never return.
never again, crazy fish.
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff.
terrible.
ripoff!
pissed off and will never go back again!
no wonder you have no customers.
don't waste your time or money.
i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables.
i think i'm going to be sick.
they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car.
i went back, paid my $_num_ and picked up my car.
he found nothing on my car to work on.
they quoted $_num_.
so they wanted to charge me another $_num_ to fix this.
after they said it was fixed just a week prior.
i went back about six months later to just get an oil change.
for a dealership to tell him he didn't need work was amazing.
avoid this place!
you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics.
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote.
no nothing.
waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call.
that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped.
before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly.
it's a few weeks later and i have had no problems.
i've experienced better, much better.
the prices are too high, the food is mediocre.
there are too many better lunch options in the area.
what happened to them, on saturday they looked like they were doing business.
from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there.
probably never going there again.
i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it.
so disappointing....
they come in plenty of flavors like red, green, orange, etc.
it was fun then, but i got older, it wore on me.
with the summer heat, fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated.
i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley.
the loud music will probably never let you down however.
apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open.
being in this bar makes me feel dirty.
the music is always insanely loud (and not even good, usually).
fat tuesday's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave.
i've never had the food but the drinks are so-so.
avoid.
and i should hate it.
the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner.
it's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami.
but fat tuesday's has it.
well, all fat tuesday's besides this one.
whoever had that idea should be fired.
if your like frozen drinks, this is your place.
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar.
i went here this past saturday and the place was packed.
somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place.
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty.
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy.
if he was trying to be funny, it didn't work.
the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer.
what a disappointment.
sadly, fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it.
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude.
um, i'm sorry?
did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order?
i wanted so badly to love this place.
it's that bad.
not because of the alcohol in my drink, but because of the sugar.
it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine.
not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink.
you don't charge $_num_ for very little, bland tasting crawfish!
the crawfish itself was small too.
i don't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish.
i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment.
was actually there tonight.
it was so sugary that i didn't want it.
so lame it makes me laugh.
oh wait, not i'm not.
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed.
i will never ever, ever, ever, ever go here again.
when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info.
very poor service.
worst customer service i have ever received in a long time.
don't waste your time.
absolutely no point.
horrible experience!
not prepared for world cup.
she said game would be over, before i would got food.
she said they didn't have enough time to prep food.
should have left but i didn't want to miss game.
and leave the single person with poor service!
if i could give a zero star i would.
verdict: i won't be back.
if i could give this place zero stars i would.
fortunately i caught myself and didn't fall onto their nasty floor.
i hadn't even drank anything yet.
bull.
very disappointing.
do not go to this establishment.
hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again.
ick.
just ick.
they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking.
why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me.
like $_num_ - $_num_.
outdated hotel for the price, room i was in was dirty.
the less than good - really low shower heads.
no extra blankets or pillows in the room.
* tub would not drain & remained half full!
unsatisfied!
this one is the worst we have ever stayed in.
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate.
no tv remote in the room.
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee.
i still haven't received it.
we were really disgusted!
the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund.
horrible place!
i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores.
okay despite everyone's glowing reviews this place is absurd!
we left without making a purchase and i will not be back.
i hate that.
they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place.
but i can't get over the awful service.
i guess i'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores.
_num_) absolutely no organization in the wine section.
ick.
_num_) the aisle are ridiculously tiny.
thank goodness the store was empty tonight.
_num_) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust!
it doesn't take that much effort to clean up the store.
that just seems like a sin.
(cheaper than texas, not as cheap as cali.)
it's not worth your time.
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store.
what a disaster this place is.
i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store.
the problem is, i wasn't looking for beer.
immediately, i know something was wrong.
i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone.
never coming back here; sketchy employees and overpriced beer.
seriously probably the worst corner store ever.
the staff are...well, you couldn't hire worse individuals.
great selection of beer at reasonable prices, what's not to love?
i'm dumb.
i apologized immediately.
he says nothing and doesn't even acknowledge me.
tops liquor, this guy is losing you business.
just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff.
my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll.
finally, after over a week, mike called me.
_num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me...voice mail.
no call back whatsoever.
luckily, a competitor that did call back got the job.
they haven't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago.
do not use this company!
i have spent _num_ separate stays here.
i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish.
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food.
there was a police report on the seat.
the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened.
this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home.
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up.
they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking.
what a horrible representation this person, william is for sheraton.
my experience here was terrible!
could have stayed at the w for that money!
rather not stay here again tho.
i was not very pleased with the quality of this hotel.
-the a/c is not good.
actually, i'm sitting in a hilton room as i type this.
was the experience awful?
am i staying during my next trip?
would i stay here again if i had too?
ordered room service, the food was cold.
won't stay there again.
sometimes it was difficult getting hot water in the showers.
the room instantly filled with an overwhelming smell of burning death.
then every _num_ minutes or so i would hear planes pass by right above.
do not stay in room _num_ or around there.
i find this appalling and ridiculous.
furthermore, i will never give priceline my business again either.
hotel is clean but extremely dated.
carpet is worn, wallpaper coming off the walls and bathrooms with minimal lighting.
this hotel has been a nightmare to deal with...not calling back.
i was sorely disappointed.
at this point i have no further expectations.
i will not go back to this hotel again.
i was very disappointed.
i provided feedback after my stay via the automatic email that i received.
this hotel is tired, dingy, and in poor repair.
i might be back, hopefully the hotel will be updated.
the carpeting looked kind of dirty and it was musty smelling too.
breakfast was weird.
the wifi is horrible.
the air conditioner was noisy.
wall paper in the bathroom was ugly and looked cheap.
the air conditioner didn't work very well which is a problem in arizona.
you'd have better luck finding gold then an ice machine here.
i left three messages without a call back.
our stay over the weekend here was horrible.
we were lied to on many occasion by different staff and they were rude.
nick at the front desk even started yelling at one of our friends.
it would not close all the way shut.
the gentleman was really apologetic and immediately gave me a new room.
doesn't cleaning staff report this?
i actually selected this location based on _num_ things: _num_ proximity to airport.
_num_ price _num_ gym.
their only weight machine was out of order.
the conference room was even out of order.
i couldn't even connect in my room.
i reported this twice and nothing was done.
one girl just said, "that stinks."
the breakfast is not a deal by booking in advance.
the front desk refused to assist.
first day at breakfast was horrible.
no clean tables.
there is water damage on the first floor so the rooms smell.
the overhead light in my room doesn't work.
so not worth it.
worst sheraton in the country.
they recently renovated rooms but should have renovated management and staff.
rooms smell bad, are still dated.
food is horrible.
we catered for meeting and we would have done better going to mcdonald's.
disgusting.
the sandwiches not so good.
recently, the ownership and menu changed and with it went everything else.
in addition, the service has gotten significantly slower.
actually, most of my office has stopped going there.
actually, most of my office has stopped going there.
this will be my first _num_ star review.
well, i am disappointed to say the least.
took over an hour and _num_ minutes for my food.
everything was very chaotic and the wait times were absolutely ridiculous.
it was disgusting.
the potatoes weren't done.
the toast was burnt as well.
it was impossible to eat.
i was a regular until the new owners purchased the business.
another _num_ minutes for my coffee to arrive.
i was neglected from this point forward.
for $_num_ there should be more food there.
veggie omelet - $_num_ + $_num_ for cheese.
this omelet is tasteless and has an oily feel in my mouth.
gross.
this came with a side of cold, soggy potatoes, also flavorless.
did all my appointments to get this.
the staff is rude and the dr. does not spend time with you.
i cant rate him he gets a _num_ in my book.
i read other reviews on him and all were bad.
they had no empathy for my pain if it wasn't headache related.
it's really quite sad that this is the business model they chose.
the first time i went to this place, i got a veggie yakisoba.
the second time i went i got a tofu veggie thing over rice.
i could not believe my ears lol.
almost no meat.
bulgogi was not well seasoned.
the food was bland and nasty.
was not worth the _num_ bucks.
would not go back again.
new ownership came, they changed the recipes so now it's gone downhill.
i miss the old tokyo stop.
ordered the chicken katsu and it was not fresh.
for lunch, i had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs.
not to mention, the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland.
we both were very disappointed.
the food was terrible.
she took _num_ bites and was afraid to eat more.
this is not authentic japanese cuisine.
katsu is not katsu, fried chicken bits.
excellent chinese and superb service.
my favorite chinese food in az!
it's full of fresh ingredients, light and tasty.
we had the shrimp with vegetables and shrimp fried rice - both lovely.
they're quite generous with the shrimp!
i had christmas dinner at george's and thought it to be the best.
as i said, best ever!
didn't know this type cuisine could be this great!
go there, eat, enjoy!
best chinese food i've had in a long time.
finding excellent chinese is always a challenge.
so happy to find george and sons!
i recommend ordering the "special chicken" really good!
you actually can enjoy a conversation.
both dishes prepared with quality veggies.
the house chow fun was also superb.
high quality food at prices comparable to lower quality take out.
the food is excellent and the service is exceptional!
the waitresses are friendly and helpful.
my experience was brief, but very good.
she went thru the menu, was patient, and friendly.
great food!
george is terrific.
highly recommended.
my favorite place for chinese delivery but wow is it pricey.
best place for chinese in the area.
i live right down the street and i was craving some good chinese food.
i will be going back!
the restaurant itself is romantic and quiet.
i highly recommend this place for romantic dinners or even any event!
we will be back each and everytime we want to eat out!
finally a restaurant worth talking about!
i highly recommend this place!
my appetizer was also very good and unique.
they also served brown rice for an extra charge.
i would recommend a visit here.
it is always good to find quality local spots when traveling.
this is the best chinese we have found in this area.
george runs a good ship!
the good is good, all the time and that's important to us.
the food is always fresh and tasty.
i was just one of those lucky enough to find this one!
see you here!
george runs a good ship!

great deal.
both times i have eaten the lunch buffet and it was outstanding!
but so far the place is a must eat!
i really like the food here in general.
besides that, the wine selection they have is pretty awesome as well.
amazing food, very unique.
they made sure everything was perfect and that we were satisfied.
it was delicious!
excellent service, good food, and nice atmosphere.
the new york eggrolls are outstanding and the beef dishes we ordered were flavorful.

best time to eat here is for lunch anytime of the week.
excellent quality and friendly service.
everything tasted great and the service was excellent.
we will definitely come back here!
the food was quite good, and they even had live music!
overall, it was a very positive dining experience.
this place was fantastic!
this will be our new date night spot!
we'll definitely be back!
excellent service, too!
great location.
very clean and really nice people.
they make good sandwiches.
it's in my neighborhood, so i'll definitely be back.

it's well-maintained and cleaning.
then you can't go wrong with the subway.
but the sandwich came out good.
clean facility!

cashiers are nice and there are good deals here.
i would definitely recommend this place.
good prices and excellent service.

she is the best kept secret in scottsdale!
i thought the owners were trustworthy and genuine.
they always give honest advice and actually care about the customer.
family owned & operated and the owners are always there.
friendly neighborhood place.
a fun selection of unique jewelry too.
i got a watch battery replaced here today.
i'll definitely use them again!
they are very professional and a top notch jeweler.
you will be in good hands.
great place to go for watch and jewelry repairs.
they also have nice selection of vintage jewelry.
after three decades of watch buying i found a home!
so happy.
honest all the way.
i highly recommend this place - it is amazing.

my dog stays here every time we go out of town.
karen takes very good care of the dogs.
i am so glad that we finally found always unleashed.
i had the benefit of finding always unleashed!

this place is so great!
she was super sweet!
when we got down to business however, i was very impressed.
annie is great!
she gets the work done and does an amazing job.
she is straight to the point and i love that type of customer service.
everything ha always come out wonderfully.
service has always been excellent.
highly highly impressed!

i would recommend her time and again.
super fast and accomodating for large groups!
i've lived here for over a year and it's been very pleasant.
the office staff is super friendly and efficient.
great location to stores, restaurants and other amenities.
and remember it's a community and other people live here too besides you.
i recommend the night tour.
i always take visitors here.
even though i have been many times, i always enjoy myself.
was excellent and i guess i signed up for the _num_ minute tour.
i highly recommend coming to visit if you're in the phoenix area.
the tour was great and informative.
