business dinner , staff was very professional , good selection of wine .
business meeting was a success and we all left happy and satisfied .
business 's are completely allowed to do things like that .
bus somehow my power bill always was super high .
but 2pm came and went and no surprise , but no one showed up .
but a bit more beat up then a typical westin .
but after eating here it was disappointing .
but after renovation , it seemed like they became desperate for money .
but after the first night the experience changed to pain .
but again , i did n't actually taste them .
but again ... i 'm just not impressed .
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
but again she said she would not take an order from me .
but again they were the experts , so i trusted them .
but again this could be the reason prices are lower than most places .
but a good spot to hit for a burger !
but a half an hour wait was a little ridiculous .
but , alas , i was disappointed .
but a little cleanliness never hurt anyone .
but alize should really just give up already .
but all in all i was very pleased .
but all of this should have been done before moving anyone in !
but all the displays were old and run down .
but , all they got was the run around .
but also nothing that made it stand out , other than location .
but ... and it 's a big one - the room sucked .
but an extra $ _num_ for watered down salsa mad the experience worse .
but an hour later , where was the roll away ?
but anyways , i enjoyed their ramen .
but apart from that it was an excellent threading experience .
but apparently , he is n't paid to listen .
but apparently riviera staff had something different in mind .
but as i said , you get what you pay for .
but as my experience for the food , it was not good at all .
but as they mentioned it was well worth it .
but at 8pm she decided she was closed and kicked all her customers out !
but , atleast i can say i 've gone .
but at least it was n't crowded .
but at sun valley it would have been more than $ _num_ !
but at this point i felt like i needed a shower .
but back to the pool story : it was not worth it .
but back to the torta that originally brought me in .
but being a customer i feel that it was poor service .
but but our food was wonderful & our waiter & busboy were very attentive .
but by far the best thing was the filet sliders !
but considering the fact that i went there for food it was a disappointment .
but did n't see any .
but did they have to be so rude about it ?
but do not run into any problems .
but due to the noise factor i would not recommend staying here .
but eh , i would n't come here again .
but ended up being good .
but enjoyed the sea bass , crab cake , and prawns anyway !
but even agent said it would n't make a difference .
but even for a free room , i would n't return .
but even for that price , we would n't go back again .
but , even if i was mistaken it was completely unprofessional .
but even that was not comfortable .
but even then i think this place would disappoint .
but even this was below it .
but even worse , the tech was very unprofessional .
but every seat had a great view .
but everything after that went downhill from there .
but everything else i 've ever had was really good .
but everything else was good !
but everything else was too salty to eat at some point .
but everything fell apart when my entree came out .
but everything on the menu has aways been fantastic .
but every time i went the service was great and the food was good .
but food really was a major let down .
but food was amazingly good .
but food was just ok .
but for about _num_ % of the time we were there .
but forget about the service , i was disappointed with the food .
but , for kids , it was great !
but for me it was perfect .
but for me that is where it ended .
but for my steak that i ordered i wasnt too happy .
but for $ _num_ ayce we really did get what we paid for .
but for one night , i could deal with stuff like this .
but for the price , i went for it .
but for the price we paid , i would not recommend this place .
but for us , that was where it ended .
but gave away room after room ... did n't get us in till 8pm .
but getting us a new room was a very low priority .
but god help you if you get stuck there like i did .
but great cold beer helped ... .
but great prices , would order from again .
, but harrah 's has nothing to set it apart .
but have enjoyed everything else .
but having to be there in the mid afternoon was a hot mess .
but he did not have any generic cats in stock .
but he just rudely took it away .
but he just tried the keys and nothing .
but he was patient and reassuring with me .
but he was very friendly and explained everything on the menu .
but he was very offensive to us .
but hey it 's vegas -- what else could one expect ?
but hey it was cheap !
but i ate here saturday night and _num_ large parties came in after us .
but i ate it .
but i brushed it off , which may have been a huge mistake .
but i came here and it was not a good experience .
but i can truly say i 've tasted everything and it 's all great .
but i could not get over how much the staff hates their jobs .
but i could n't get past how amazingly terrible this place was !
but i could n't really get into it or enjoy it .
but i did find was a room in which the air conditioning work great !
but i did n't like the atmosphere .
but i did n't pay much attention i thought i give it a try .
but i did n't take it serious because it was always busy .
but i did n't , which is why i am writing this review .
but i did pay _num_ to board in the first group .
but i did see one of them yell at a customer .
but i dont appreciate being talked to like that .
but i do n't mind , i love getting drunk so i 'm happy !
but i enjoyed my food very much .
but i expected a little more from this one .
but if i were you , i 'd probably skip it .
but if the smell has n't been taken care of .
but , if this order is lost , i will be changing the rating .
but i got ripped off that night .
but i guess i might end up going anyway .
but i had the worse experience ever .
but , i had trouble .
but i have been left with no choice at this point !
but i have enjoyed them .
but i have to say that we had a great time !
but i kind of expected it for the price we paid .
but i liked the food and service .
but i liked this place a lot !
but i lost it .
but i 'm a designer & everything is not american made like they claim .
but i 'm pretty happy with what was served .
but i 'm totally hooked on alberto !
but instead we were treated like crap .
, but , in this case , it managed to work .
but i only noticed from the texture .
but i picked up my car today and it looks fantastic .
but i really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos .
but , i should n't be paying for that anyways .
but i should n't feel so special .
but i stayed calm and walked away .
but i still bought another slice .
but i still think they were the best i 've had !
but it did not stop there .
but it did n't last .
but it ended up causing me more pain .
, but it had since expired .
but i think it should be at the same level of olive garden .
but i think they left out , `` classic stains !
but i thought it was a great little activity to do while in vegas .
but i thought the pizza was very good .
but i thought this place was terrible .
but it 's all included with your meal .
but it 's a sad , tired , shit hole nevertheless .
but it should be expected from a shabby place like this off the strip .
but it 's never set off the machine before , ever ?
but it sucked !
but it sucked .
but it was absolutely appalling .
but it was a cool experience .
but it was a little more fun doing it our way .
but it was a place to lay my head and it was n't dirty .
but it was bad !
but it was cheap and you definitely do get what you pay for .
but it was comfortable and clean .
but it was definitly well worth it .
but it was enjoyable .
but it was fine for my boyfriend and i .
but it was good .
but it was highly disrespectful and low of him .
but it was nice to have some onion rings though .
but it was nice to know that they were there if i needed them .
but it was not on sale .
but it was not worth getting sick for .
but it was n't bad either .
but it was n't even properly cleaned !
but it was _num_ degrees outside .
but it was pretty bad .
but it was pretty sweet and fruity .
but it was so so worth it .
but it was so tasty that ate it all and all of the frys .
but it was still about a _num_ min walk to encore .
but it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed .
but it was super good nonetheless .
but it was terrible .
but it was the best i 've tasted in las vegas !
but it was the excellent food !
but it was the highest i won of anything during this trip to vegas .
but it was well worth it .
but it was well worth the $ _num_ .
but , it was worth it .
but it was worth it .
but i 've been in worse hotels .
but , i 've taken several friends here and they all have loved it !
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
but i was a bit let down by what i was served .
but i was definitely not satisfied .
but i was denied service .
but i was impressed and definitely will stay again .
but i was not pleased .
but i was n't there when it happened , so i have no idea .
but i was pretty disappointed by the whole experience .
but i was quite disgusted with one thing .
but i was so excited for the food that i looked past this .
but i was so hungry i ate them all .
but i was wrong .
but i will never spend my hard earned money at this establishment .
but i would gladly pay the difference for a better customer experience .
but i would have paid $ _num_ to save the time .
but i would have to say that the garlic parmesan was mediocre .
but i would highly recommend this company based on my experience !
but i would make an appointment in the morning and she was always late .
but i would not go back here or recommend it to anyone going either .
but i would not recommend this place .
but i would n't come back here for catfish , let alone ayce catfish .
but i would n't come here just for the bread .
but i would pay more not to have to deal with the front desk .
but i would recommend getting a dessert and wine and nothing else .
but i would recommend this location if you need a quick bite .
but just had a poor customer service experience .
but just ignored it .
but lasagna , salad , baked ziti ... reasonable prices and consistent quality .
but las vegas water district did nothing !
but let me tell you , it was worth every single second .
but like i said , i did n't spend much time here anyways .
but like i said , i knew not to expect much .
but like i said , i 've only been on the dining side .
but like the boulevard mall , the years have not been kind to it .
but like the previous posts mentioned , felt like a motel _num_ set up .
but luckily i found $ _num_ in my wallet that i never use .
but lunch was not good .
but man i loved this place .
but man , they could have handled that much better !
but man , this one took all my effort .
but man , this was some good indian food and it hit the spot .
but me and my girlfriends eventually started going to happy hour .
but me and _num_ others did not like it one bit .
but most impressive and appreciated of all , the service was fantastic !
but my experience with rude staff was during the store 's busier days .
but , my friend assured me that this place was the real deal .
( but my husband loved it . )
but my journey there would not be easy .
but my last trip to mac was outstanding .
but my lovely front desk lady just chose to ignore what i was saying .
but , my recent experiences have been disappointing .
but my room in building _num_ was awful .
but my sandwich tasted like airplane food .
but my stay there was the worst time i have had in vegas .
but my steak was not good .
but my stylist apparently did n't feel like using a dryer with me .
but my visit here was amazing !
but neither of us liked anything .
but new ownership took over an it has slowly gone down hill .
but nobody else was in the store .
but none of this happened on the day i visited .
but no one came to the table to do so .
but no such room existed .
but not before i received my two subs from jimmy johns .
but , not finding a menu online , we went with this place .
but no the server refused and i asked when did this rule start ?
but not the best seafood we have had .
but no way would i skimp and book this place for a vacation .
but now it has been just too bad with some not edible items .
but _num_ hrs was not reasonable !
but occasionally i think , let me give it another shot .
but of course , you would only know if you could see the sign .
but oh no , the burger nazi could n't leave it at that .
but once again i did not get an email or a follow up call .
but once it was done it looked nothing like the picture .
but once i went to pay , they did n't want to honor it .
but once we got there we were totally disappointed !
but , one thing was the worst was the bathroom .
but on my last trip , the dealers were so slow .
but other than a _num_ minute look you should be ready to leave .
but other than that a very convenient airport , i liked it !
but other than that it was pretty good .
but other than that , the food was good .
but our dragon family style meal was outstanding !
but our experience was horrible .
but our food was very disappointing .
but our other coworker did not .
but our room had roaches !
but our service was great wished we could have had dessert .
but , our service was not good at all .
but our waiter was mia .
but our waitress , sandy , was consistent and pleasant .
but our wait time get our food was unacceptable .
but overall , green delivered a tasty meal .
but overall , including service - would not come back again !
but over all it 's a fun time and i would recommend it !
but , overall , it was n't really that bad '' .
but overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic !
, but overall we were happy with our decision to try this place !
but quality was good to excellent .
but really , a balance needs to be struck .
but really , i go here for the perfectly poured guinness .
but really though -- nothing else was special about this place .
but really , what was that going to do for us at that time .
but recently it has completely gone downhill .
but recently it 's taken a turn for the much much worse .
but recently , project manager wes impressed my family a lot .
but regardless of the reviews , we had a wonderful experience .
but rest assured i was incredibly happy with my tattoo .
but rest of my family did really enjoyed their food .
but service and prices were pretty bad .
but service was bad .
but service was horrible both times .
but she continued and continued to be mad in front of other customers .
but she left after a couple of months .
but she really gave _num_ star service !
but she was just wonderful !
but she was nonetheless offended and took our business to another nearby boutique .
but she was n't using a coupon , it was a gift card .
but she was unprofessional and was telling us the wrong things .
but ... silver lining , nick was available and he did a great job !
but , since i was there for work i really enjoyed this hotel .
but slowly moved into the hot sandwich section .
but so far , it 's been worth it .
but someone out there stole my purse and my wallet in it .
but sometimes i would get different containers .
but staying at the wynn made it feel like a real vacation !
but still a good store , just had a bit of an annoying experience .
but still , i was thinking that sounded pretty good .
but still only so so compared to what i am used to getting .
but still ... some of the typical stuff like sushi was n't that great .
but surely they would be ready today .
but tacos do n't cost $ _num_ .
but thankfully , the meatloaf was delicious , my pizza was great .
but that customer rep ruined everything .
but that did n't really work out .
but that did n't stop any of us .
but that does n't mean i would n't ever go back .
but that encounter was ridiculous .
but that has already been said .
but that 's only going off the appetizer that i ordered .
( but that thing never happened . )
but that was basically the only good thing i can say about this experience .
but that was not the case , i was that _num_ % .
but that was not worth it .
but , that was n't cooked much less than the first one .
but that was _num_ years ago .
but that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact .
but , that was short lived .
but that was still about _num_ minutes after we got it .
but the amount of money lost for future business is .
but the atmosphere was really lame .
but the bagels are the best ones i had outside of new york city .
but the bananas foster was the show and easily the best dessert .
but the beef empanadas were amazing !
but the beer was disappointing .
but the best part has got to be the staff .
but the best part of dinner was our awesome server , alyssa .
but the best part was the amazing service !
but the bone in ribeye was poor .
but the cheese was really bland .
but the customer service it was very good .
but the customer service was so bad i may not go again .
but the dates were incredible .
but the drinks contained almost no alcohol .
but the employees were so unprofessional and unsafe .
but the experience was great overall !
but the food , despite smelling so good , was simply mediocre .
but the food has always arrived hot and fresh .
but the food sucked .
but the food that i tried ... no .
but the food was also really good !
but the food was amazing .
but , the food was delicious !
but the food was good .
but the food was lukewarm when it was brought to us .
but the food was mediocre .
but the food was poor .
but , the food was rather flavorless , and nothing special at all .
but the food was really good !
but the food was so good !
but the food was some of the best i 've had around these parts .
but the food was sooooo good .
but the food was tasty .
but , the food was very good .
but the free wifi at mccarran was so great and the wait passed quickly .
but the fries were cold and stale .
but the front desk was very efficient !
but the frozen margarita was awful .
but the garlic bread was good .
but the highlight was the fatty brisket .
but the hotel part was n't as good.
but the interior was nice and the food was amazing .
but their fried mushrooms and equally amazing .
but their was barely any beef !
but their work was beyond unimpressive .
but the kicker was the buffet management .
but the last couple of visits was not the same !
but the last time i went to cc ... ... damn !
but the last two times i have been i have been less than impressed .
but the line was cut off .
but the meal was over priced and not good .
but the meat ... mushrooms and onions were really really under seasoned .
but the mediocre food could not make up for all of the above .
but then again this is vegas so that 's to be expected .
but , then again , when you 're drunk this place is probably heaven .
but , then a maid tried to enter our room about midnight .
but then i also noticed that they opened my car hood ?
but then i met charlie .
but then it was paired with something ( spinach ) that was inedible .
but then it was time to get change from the machine .
but then , our waitress was noticeably absent most of the time .
but the _num_ min wait was worth it .
but then we got in and they found stuff they liked .
but then , we sat there with no menus for _num_ minutes .
but the only original flavor was coconut .
but the overall taste was great !
but the pho has me hooked .
but the pillows were hard and the beds were harder .
but the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat .
but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok .
but the pool was nice and buffet is reasonable .
but the ppl on the phone were just as nice as always .
but the price of it all is what i disliked the most .
but the price was the worst part .
but the prime rib made up for it .
but the pump was going to charge me $ _num_ .
but the rack of lamb was perfect .
but there are only a few tables opened , one for each game .
but there is a good selection , and the philly cheesesteak station was awesome !
but the rest i loved .
but there was a sewer gas smell in our room all weekend .
but there was only one waiter .
but the room was cheap and at least clean .
but the royal was surprisingly clean and quite comfortable .
but the sad part was that it was kinda slow .
but the sandwich came out good .
but these last couple of months have been ridiculous .
but the service was absolutely horrible .
but the service was horrible .
but ... the service was okay .
but the service was slow .
but the shower was probably the worst part .
but , the spaghetti and meatballs were n't good .
but the staff was just the best !
but the steak is well made , juicy , and totally worth it .
but the steak was wonderful !
but the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us .
but the truth is we reported the allergic reaction around _num_ am .
but the urine stains on the toilet seat was dirty , smelly and disgusting .
but the very best was dessert .
but the vet i ended up with was horrible .
but the view was great we stayed on the 10th floor .
but the way he talked to us was out of the question .
but the worst discovery was the day before we were scheduled to check out .
but the worst part was the scrambled eggs .
but they also have souvenirs and toiletries if you forgot to pack something .
but they best i 've had so far .
but they could n't with harrah 's terrible wifi .
but they did attempt to remodel their rooms .
but they did have them available for nachos which were bad .
but , they did n't do it .
but they get it done and make it work .
but they had a number of good beers .
but they had happy hour and it cheap .
but they had some really weird clothes .
but they have done an amazing job and she recommended gel instead of acrylic .
but they have lost me as a customer ... at least for gaming .
but they have totally lost my business .
but they pretty much ruined my christmas eve .
but they 're always impressed .
but they server made this place bad .
but they set a table for us and accommodated our party .
but they should never have sent it out of the kitchen .
but they still chose to open only _num_ lanes !
`` , but they still refused to honor it .
but they use no one and they should .
but , they were not that pleasing to the taste buds .
but they were overpriced and not all that nice .
but ... they were undercooked and the batter had zero flavor .
but this dude did n't tell me that .
but this guy did n't do that .
but this is one instance where i would rather have gone to the strip .
but this jiffy lube was fantastic .
but this never happened .
but this one lady was so rude .
but this one really was a disappointment .
but this pharmacy has showed a complete lack of compassion and/or concern .
but this phone call was very off putting .
but this place did not feel ... safe i guess you could say .
but this place has turned from a dive bar to just trash .
but this place is awesome we love them and you should too !
but this place nailed it !
but this place was a good choice .
but this place was just ridiculous .
but this time around , it was just horrible .
but this time , i felt compelled to spread the word and warn others .
but this time i ordered the prime rib ... .
but this time it took _num_ minutes to get my food .
but this used to be one of our favorite vegas stops .
but this was a complete rip off .
but this was a nightmare .
but this was horrible .
but this was just ridiculous .
but , this was not the issue .
but this was probably the absolute worst meal i paid for in my life .
but this was too much of a dive .
but this wine list was overwhelming to say the least .
but today was the worst .
but to make matters worse , parking was horrible .
but tonight we definitely did !
but twice , the dining room was closed !
but ultimately it comes down to service and ours was not up to par .
but unfortunately i 'm forced to give it _num_ .
but unfortunately the bad tasting chicken left a horrible taste in my mouth .
but vegas offers few choices so we went .

it should be a crime to consider this a _num_ star hotel .
it should be called golden palm dump !
it should be for you as well .
- it should be $ _num_ .
it should have no star at all .
it should have _num_ stars !
it should not be the luck of the draw .
it should n't be difficult to get medication ever .
it should n't be so hard to accommodate loyal customers .
it should n't take this long for an oil change .
it simply was not worth it .

it 's $ $ in cost , but worth going to !
it 's just a hole in the wall , but it was great !

it 's just a well laid out airport .

it smelled so bad .
it smelled terrible and so did the whole room .
it smelled terrible and was super tacky .
it smelt amazing and they have so much variety like i have never seen .
it 's more like a family owned restaurant feeling .
it 's my own fault for not understanding the room situation before i booked .
it 's not a piece that would break just because .
it 's not a place i would come to again .
it 's not a place i would 've picked myself .
it 's not as good as it smelled or looked .

it 's not high brow fare but it is bar food done right .
it 's nothing incredibly fancy , but i enjoyed it .
