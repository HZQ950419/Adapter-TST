and if you are female , you better believe they will .
and if you do , don't go to four peaks .
and if you want them grilled its another buck .
and i get the gyro sandwich every time and its the best .
and i highly recommend both the locals and tourists to avoid this place .
and i just can not believe it it is outrageous .
and i like two buck chuck !
and i live _num_ miles away !
and i'll probably request a refund for this night as well .

and let's be honest .
and lets face it , their merchandise is not cheap .
and look how much noodles you get for $ _num_ .
and love that they take good care of my baby .
and make for a perfect gift .
and management doesn't do anything about it .
and maybe better than all of that , they are consistent !
and maybe that's not even a far stretch .
and meticulous with the nails .
and most importantly it's clean .
and most importantly , the car honestly looks as good as new .
and , no joke , the food here is really good .
and no managers to speak to .
and not to mention the place is beautiful !

and really is only $ _num_ cheaper than a taxi .
and ribs that fall apart in your mouth from being so moist and tasteful !
and , rude counter help doesn't help at all ... .
and salsa are not free .
and , second , this place sucks .
and service is usually very good !
and speaking of food , it's crappy half the time now .
and splurge and eat the bread ... worth it !
and that does not make much of a standard to meet .
and that includes taco bell .
and that is good because one or two sizes does not fit all .
and that is just the part , add another _num_ for `` labor'' .
and that is not normal we leave _num_ to _num_ % almost always .
and that is what makes him so absolutely charming .

burrito express is the best place for burritos .
burritos are plain and full of grease .
but after two tries i will look elsewhere .
but a good spot to enjoy for an early morning bite .
but alas , a great massage does not make a spa .
but avoid this store at all costs !
but believe me , they will never fix your car's problem .
but both visits featured mediocre food ( esp .
but bottled water does count so that's good too .
but by far the best thing this place has to offer is the food .
but can it really be bad ?
but come halloween and having fun , that seems a bit tacky and tasteless .
but do not eat entree's .
but don't expect something worthwhile .
but don't try this garbage sober .
but don't worry it doesn't end there .
but , enjoy the food !
but even just getting pepperoni is amazing .
but every thing they serve is amazing .
but every week , they have great deals on something !
but for a buck , it's still a great deal !
but - for good fresh stuff ! )
but for its size , new tokyo certainly packs in a lot of goods .
but for $ _num_ i expect a lot more .
but hey , if it works , keep doing it !
but hey , i'm from ca .
but hey , it's tempe .
but honestly the food isn't that good .
but honestly , they have everything under the sun .
but i also am not a jerk .
but i am sure i won't go back again .
but i can't do that every issue can i ?
but , i couldn't even keep this promise to myself .
but i don't see much hope for their future .
but if chain suits your fancy buca is pretty cool .
but if you can't , enjoy inside as it is great .
but if you eat something spicy then you won't care .
but if you have plenty of time to waste , definitely go there .
but if you love noodle , don't miss this place !
but if you're a sports fan , the atmosphere is terrific .
but if you're looking for great sushi , go elsewhere .
but i guess shame on me for just looking for average service in scottsdale .
but i have no idea how they can call these the best rib's .
but i have to say i'm disappointed .
but i just can't eat here again .
but i just can't get into your pizza .
but i know i wont ever get all three .
but i like !
but i love a meatball sub .
but i love this place .
but i mean it's a motel _num_ .
but i'm glad some people keep away - it means more for me !
but i'm not in a hurry to return .
but i'm not willing to come back after this experience .
but i'm quite literally here _num_ times a week .
but i'm really disappointed with it and not going back .
but i'm sure it's great !
but i officially hate joes .
but i order here often as its just high quality all the time .
but i promise you , it'll be worth it .
but i really like it nonetheless .
but irish pub , you are kidding me .
but i still hate it so so much .
but it is always interesting .
but it is an authentic retro , ice cream parlor .
but it is definitely worth the wait .
but it is worth it !
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
but it probably sucks too !
but its a good thing because thats how popular they are in our are .
but it's all worth it !
but it's always great here .
but it's always nice to have something before the main course .
but it's enough to never return .
but it's full of frustration to shop now .
but it's just not working for me .
but it's nice i have that option .
but it's not !
but it's not .
but it's not even cheap .
but it's not really .
but it's shoddy that runs through .
but it's still delicious and i can't wait to go back again .
but it's still one my go to places for watching games !
but it's still open _num_ hours .
but , it's still tender and yummy .
but its the services that makes it great .
but it's worth it .
but it's worth seeking out .
but it works with the food !
but i will never buy it again .
but i will not go back .
but i won't be back .
but i won't be coming back .
but i won't take my chances .
but i wouldnt want to take my niece and nephew .
but , just be careful .
but , let me start with some positives .
but , let's face it , life's too short to be miserable .
but let this story begin at noon today .
but love this office !
but make sure to check your bill !
but malee's is excellent , excellent food .
but man , it's just not anything special , and also overpriced .
but my favorite are their calzones !
but my other friend's wine just didnt arrive .
but neither one sounds intelligent .
but not good enough for me to go back .
but no , the owner doesn't care about it .
but no , this barista keeps having this conversation .
but not worth going back for .
but _num_ can't really consider itself a magazine , can it ?
but only _num_ bottled water per person .
but other than that , so off the mark .
but ... personality does not a good chinese restaurant make .
: ) but quality , honest work .
but really , the wait staff sucks .
but regardless , this place is a `` must go to'' .
but seriously food is good .
but sometimes it's worth paying a premium for location .
but still , love this place !
but such a fun find .
but , sugar bowl is worth it !
but that can definitely be overlooked with food this amazing !
but that doesn't explain the previous two visits .
but that's not why i'm giving them one star .
but that's part of the charm from my perspective .
but the availability of truly great beer is a thing of wonder .
but the burgers are good , and the fries .
but the cakes are amazing !
but the cleanliness is seriously , seriously lacking .
but the crowd and music is great so you won't even notice .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
but the delivery is late every single time .
but the dinner prices are a bit steep for the middle class .
but the family bean curd ( tofu ) dish is perfectly tasteful and spicy .
but the flavor of the steaks omg are amazing .
but the food is different and delicious .
but the food is excellent !
but the food is so , so good .
but the food is still great .
but the food is your typical fast food chinese place .
but the fork is a great place .
but their bagels are amazing .
but their food , really is impressive .
but their hummus is fantastic !
but their service is horrible .
but then again tempe is a strange place .
but then there are the times where it just doesn't come together .
but then , we get home & i start eating my food .
but the price is still very reasonable .
but the real gem here is the wine cellar .
but the real treat is the oj that they sell on site ... .
but there are so many flies in the restaurant it's almost unbearable .
but there is also a reason why i suppose .
but there is neither , just excuses .
but there's not much to get on or do .
but the rest is pretty quick !
but the reviews are correct , the drink prices are ridiculous .
but the rooms are not so nice .
but the salt cellar is amazing !
but the sandwiches are kind of small .
but these office people do not have it together .
but the service is awful .
but the service is horrible .
but the service sucks .
but the star of the show is definitely the soup !
but the true hero is the coffee , perfectly brewed and delicious !
but the true treasure is the food .
but the worst thing is the owner .
but they are charging late fees on late fees .
but they are close and deliver !
but they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues .
but they can trick you with the pay scheduling .
but they come with _num_ & great for the table .
but they do a great job .
but they don't have any ideas for nail art .
but they don't need you , so don't go .
but they have so much good stuff .
but they're fun and looking for a good time .
but they suck when it comes to order pick up .
but this is unacceptable .
but this is where things go downhill .
but this one isn't worth going to .
but this one , this one , folks , is seriously a winner .
but , this one wins me over .
but this pizza is amazing !
but this place has a great breakfast with great service .
but this place is awesome !
but this place is my new fav sushi spot !
but this place is so good i have to .
but this place is so legit !
but this place is wonderful .
but to me this is unacceptable .
but to my pleasant surprise , these guys are awesome .
but unfortunately , dont think i will .
but unless they do that , we are not going back again .
but until then , this is the best you will get .
but we enjoy mixing our own dish depending on our mood that day .
but we warn you , it's definitely a meal so come hungry !
but we won't be back here again .
but we won't be coming back .
but what i hate is bad service .
but what really makes this spot special is the food .
but when i drive over there i find they are mia .
but when it comes to customer service it really lacks .
but when it comes to full priced dinners ... go elsewhere .
but when we do , we feel comfortable leaving him here .
but when you do the food is good and the service is good .
but who gives a crap ?
but who knows , maybe that's you .
but why is everything on their menu a mock of regular , meaty foods ?
but with a group , you can have a lot of friends here .
but worst of all is their illegal leasing practices .
but wow , i love the `` cowboy ciao'' chopped salad .
but you can not order _num_ wings with two different flavors at $ _num_ .
but you pay for the quality .
but you will definitely find it there .
buy a membership and enjoy a break from the heat !
buyer beware , its not what you think it is .
buy more blueberries or make less .
buy them online and save , even after shipping .

i'm sure she won't issue a refund because - surprise !
i'm sure the rest is amazing .
i'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
i'm sure they will suffer the same fate .
i'm sure we'll be here a lot in the summer .
i'm sure we will be back !
i'm taking my business elsewhere .

i'm visiting mesa from los angeles .
i'm with caesar , avoid this place like the plague .
i'm with the other reviewers : keep this in the defalco family !
in addition , don is a kind man and cares about the restaurant .
in addition , make sure that you try their coffee .
in addition , they do not offer a military discount .
in addition to a site to see a place to eat .
in all , this is not my type of place .
in any event , we will not be back to cowboy ciao .
in arizona in july , this is not a good thing .
inattentive servers , empty glasses , empty plates .
in a word , this place is as good as it gets !
in closing , a little difficult to find , but well worth the hunt !
in conclusion , this business deserves to fail .
in conclusion , this place is overpriced with limited options .
incredible service and work .
incredibly arrogant person if you ask me .
incredibly long wait times .
incredibly rude , and slow to fix issues .
indeed the restroom is fancy and very clean .
i need a filling , i get a filling .
i need the thrill of the hunt !
i need two seconds .
in england they don't serve nachos .

i never really get this angry about something .
i never want to go to this hospital again .
i never write reviews but the service here is worth my first review .
i never write reviews on yelp but zizzo is seriously so great !
inexpensive and delicious , what more can you ask for .
in fact , i consistently get better food and service at red robin .
in fact , i'm considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau .
in general it feels small and is usually empty for a reason .
in keeping with chain restaurants style , the food is very unimpressive .
in my experience , this is an exceptional company .
in my opinion , definitely not worth the hour wait .
in my opinion , good food does not make up for horrible customer service .
in my opinion that is very poor customer service .
in my opinion , that ruins a small intimate show .
in my opinion this salon is dark and outdated .
in my option , this the best for pizza and wings hands down .
in my world , that's as good as it gets !
in old town it's very well priced !
i normally dont do that if you buy a beer ?
i normally don't like beans but their beans are sooooo good .
i normally enjoy coming here .
i normally get the chimis with their poblano sauce ; so good .
i normally go for reverse happy hour on sundays !

in other words , their pizza is horrible .
i now have gotten a new honda and will continue to take both cars .
i now see that this slow service runs through all the yelp reviews .
in particular , as others have mentioned , the al pastor is fantastic .
in particular leslie rocks , always a pleasure to visit with her .
in phoenix for _num_ weeks for work from la .
in scottsdale , this place is a must !
in short , do not trust these people with your dogs .
in short , don't waste you time .
inside is cute and the service is good .
inside is even better .
inside is kind of small but i always get togo .
inside is totally fine .
instead , a garlicky ranch type dressing .
instead he takes the opportunity to practice his sit-down comedy act i guess .
instead i say not to waste your time .
instead of trying to get me in and take care of me .
instructors keep the material fun .
insulting , dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke !
insurance last billed on may _num_ , _num_ .''
`` in surprise and disappointment , darn it !
interesting food combinations that definitely please the taste buds .
interesting place to watch people and enjoy some cheap drinks and eats !
interesting , well organized antique store which can be challenging .
interior design is very dated and in need of a complete deep cleaning .
interior is also pretty tiny , so don't expect to eat inside .
in terms of customer service , they're less than stellar ... for sure .
in terms of starbucks , this one is definitely my favorite !
internet is abysmal and spotty .
in texas , tamales are much smaller .
in the end , all the better i figure .
in the end poor customer service , no courtesy calls , and poor information .
in the end , you realize , your child is just a dollar sign .
in the meantime , it's always worth a trip to one posh place .
in the mean time it sounds great thanks to fred .
in these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way .
in the short will never ever never visit this establishment again .
in the `` upgraded'' apartment there is a washer and dryer in unit .
in this age , it is very rare .

it's no wonder why people prefer to go to buffets .
it's _num_ _num_ and you are standing doing nothing !
it's obvious the employees don't care about the customers or the service .
it so `` i hate my life !

so many wonderful programs for all ages .
somebody needs to rescue this dq .
some clerks are helpful , a couple of them are not so much .
some days they are more friendly than others , but overall everyone is pleasant .
some dishes even come with the sopapillas for desert .
