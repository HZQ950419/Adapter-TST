but circus circus does .
but cool , we 'll take a free meal . ''
but customer service is weak .
but damn - i love this store and the forum shops .
but deciding between the two can be difficult .
but definitely get the shrimp linguini .
but definitely not good enough to make up for horrible service .
but definitely stop !
but definitely will be back .
but definitely worth the try .
but do not assume that a guest is smoking drugs when they are n't .
but do not go there to eat in .
but do not order the happy hour ahi .
but do n't expect any help from any of the employees .
but do n't expect anything good here .
but do n't expect it to be nice , the double tree is nicer .
but do n't expect quality food .
but do n't get your hopes up .
but do n't go here .
but do n't order the chips it will disappoint you .
but do n't play the slots there , you ca n't win !
but do n't stay the night here .
but do n't take my word for it .
but do n't waste your time .
but do use as a toilet pit stop .
but even she ca n't save this place from a two star review .
but everyone is wonderful !
but everything else is amazing .
but everything else is so good they still get _num_ stars from me !
but everything else rocks .
but everything is pretty good .
but fat tuesday 's has it .
but first eat the calamari .
but food and service is worth it .
but food is great .
but for a regular local there is n't much to see or do .
but for a variety of smoke shop products , mr. bill 's is great .
but for being a downtown hotel i love this place !
but forget all that , the food is bland .
but for like $ _num_ for _num_ nights , i ca n't really complain .
but , for me , i do n't get it .
but for me , next time ill just find something better .
but for me , next time ill just play poker and make money .
but for me , that 's not how i roll .
but for some good home cooking , carrie 's is quite good .
but for the most part the food is bad .
but for what it is - mariscos - it is fantastic .
but friendly service , great belly dancing show , and delicious food .
but getting rid of an excellent kitchen staff does n't make sense .
but golden nugget to me is not worth the expense .
but good chocolate is never cheap anyway .
but grabbing to go is good as well .
but guess what ?
but hands down , their staff is amazing !
but heck u get what u pay for !
but hell it is vegas !
but here 's the thing ... the food is disgusting .
but here 's what i am sure about .
but here 's why i give them _num_ stars .
but here you receive a meal with a view .
but he 's not there anymore and they know that .
but he sounds so honest when he asks how your doing .
but hey a cup of coffee and a good breakfast make my whole day !
but hey , i feel for them .
but his friendly comfortable personality is what really makes his business .
but , honestly , does it really take 30-45 minutes to make food ?
but honestly , they make a damn good pie .
but how can you mess up a hot dog ?
but i always come back !
but i always have fun here .
but i always say quality is always worth it !
but i am expecting flavor with a little kick .
but i am not into this kind of thing at all .
but i am not okay with spending $ _num_ on a _num_ minute lesson .
but i believe the service at this particular walmart is worse than most .
but i can overlook that because of the food .
but i can tell you this place can make it however you want .
but i ca n't get over the awful service .
but i come here for the food !
but i do need my dogs with me 24/7 .
but , i do n't care about furniture that much .
but i do n't judge a book by its cover .
but i do n't like giving negative feedback .
but i do n't spend money where i am not respected .
but i do n't think i 'll be back .
but i do n't think i 'll give it a third chance .
but i do recommend .
but , i doubt i will go there again .
but i do very well on the machines there .
but i enjoy getting takeout from here .
but i feel this place needs a good one .
but if you are paying , consider other places .
but if you do n't , do not order .
but if you dont like kids , dont go here .
but , if you enjoy architecture , the trip is well worth it .
but if you have a special diet they will take care of you .
but if you have to go , do n't wait in line .
but if you know the trick ... you can get your food fast .
but if you like food and being alive do not eat here !
but , if you 're a girl in vegas you will have fun .
but , if you 're looking for the vegas strip - go there instead .
but if you want a chain style caribbean version , bahama breeze is great .
but if you want some quite time the interior seating is best .
but if you want stylish , great hair , grooming humans wins hands down !
but i guess not .
but i guess opening the dirt lot to the public is better than nothing .
but , i guess shame on us for not asking .
but i guess that 's what you get for the price .
but i guess they do n't base it off of your credit .
but i guess they reserve tables for groups who do the bottle service .
but i guess you get for what you pay !
but i guess you get what you pay for .
, but i have to say that this place is very nice .
but i just think that they have some room for improvement .
but , i like the ones from crown bakery in chinatown much better .
but i 'll let you judge if it worth _num_ dollars or not .
but i 'll still come back because the quality is excellent for the price .
but i love it anyways .
but i love ralph in the liquor section .
but i love the casino area and also the bay city diner located inside .
but i love the stores here .
, but i 'm just going to leave it as this .
but , i 'm never coming back here again .
but im still giving this place a _num_ cause its nice and new .
but i must compliment them on their service .
but i need to get some frustration off my chest .
but in reality , i know there will be no outcome from this .
but in terms of their burgers , they are delicious !
but in vegas , i expect a little bit better .
but i play craps and they have an _num_ second dice setting rule .
but i probably wouldnt stay here again .
but i recommend the one on glendale ( they serve alcohol there ) .
but is it fairly good and reasonable ?
but is nice .
but i still come here pretty often .
but i still get some of the same attitude there too .
but , i still like it and they really represent some classic businesses .
but i still love the variety and the quality for the buck .
but it didnt stop him from being extremely rude !
but it does n't .
but it does n't go to the airport .
but it does the job .
but , it gets worse ... .
but it gets worse .
but , it gets worse from there .
but it has very little to do with local natural history .
but it is all good .
but it is all really good and a great neighborhood breakfast and lunch joint .
but it is by far the tastiest and the decoration is nice and classy .
but - it is cheap .
but it is cheap !
but it is cheap .
but it is delicious that it 's easy to overlook all of this .
but it is good til the next day .
but it is great .
but it is not a option .
but it is not at all nice .
but it is not quite the experience i remember from even 5-10 years ago .
but it is , perhaps , the end of the beginning .
but it is quite efficient - for americans anyway .
but it is quite fun !
but it is really quite a shame that this only deserves one star .
but it is soooooo good you will .
but it is what it is .
but it is worth a try .
but it is worth it .
but it is worth the risk .
but it just is n't happening .
but it just tastes disgusting .
but it 's a great place for lunch if you are craving italian food .
but it 's all for a good cause .
but its a nice little romantic spot to relax with your boo .
but its better just to stay at motel _num_ .
but , its impossible to get a table .
but it 's not close to where i live .
but it 's still empty .
but its still good , and worth the trip down there .
but its too bad i will never stay there again .
but it sure does n't deserve anything higher than _num_ .
but , it 's worth the search .
but it 's worth the stop at an atm .
but it taste very good !
but i will be back !
but i will be back ... i love those mac nuts !
but i will definitely be back here !
but , i will definitely return for the garlic bread .
but , i will never be back , because of the extremely rude attitude .
but i will not be going back .
but i will not be staying at the golden gate hotel and casino again .
but i will not return .
but i wo n't be coming back here .
but just a short freeway drive from the strip and worth it !
but kudos to that employee because you are doing a stand up job .
but kung fu does n't give any breaks with the soup .
but let me tell you , its great fun !
but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry .
but let me tell you what really shines .
but look for john , he has a story or two !
but main courses are huge and so tasty .
but many of my problems with the wynn are specific .
but megan is the best !
but mostly , the staff is incredible .
but mostly , you go because it comes with unlimited table wine .
but most of all the bed is a dream come true .
but most of the staff is very rude .
but most of the time , it 's disappointing and i regret my decision .
but my favorite place to drink in general .
but my favorite thing is their hot sauce .
but nathan 's fast food is the worst .
but never again will i stay at a place with this many bad reviews .
but nevertheless for experienced craps players this is a terrible place to play .
but next time i will return to mussels and pasta !
but no airline is perfect .
but no , more lies and excuses .
but none of my family will return because of dee .
but nonetheless a great time - large dance floor next to the dj booth !
but no one is there .
but no shower water !
but not cheap enough to attract me back .
but no thank you .
but nothing like this .
but nothing special about black bear .
but no those prices do n't matter !
but no worries .
but no worries i am here for the shrimp .
but now , there is neither .
but $ _num_ for a single print is too much .
but _num_ minutes later , we get the tomato juice ?
but _num_ w sahara is the worst of the worst .
but occasionally we like the quiet local joints in this part of the city .
but of course , i didnt say a word .
but oh wait i have no more cash .
but oh well ... to each is own .
but once you do , they are fairly helpful and knowledgeable .
but once you find it , you 'll keep coming back !
but once you step into the restaurant , you 're transformed .
but one item can not really do the trick .
but one of my order suppose to have no whip cream on .
but one sour waiter makes for a lemon of a meal .
but other in my party always want to be closer to the strip .
but other than that food is good.
but other than that i love this place !
but other than that this bar is really cool .
but other than that , we love it here !
but otherwise i try to avoid it if at all possible .
but otherwise , this location is kind of hard to recommend .
but outside of that this place is a heart attack waiting to happen .
but overall , they are still really nice .
but overall , this place is great as a buffet .
but passengers miss it all the time .
but people here are very rude .
but please call them first to make sure you can have it .
but please never intend to sleep here !
but please , please do n't insult me by serving what they call pizza .
but , really , do n't .
but really , do n't stay here !
but really , the best money for hotel stay on fremont .
but really , the overall verdict - christmas eve dinner fail .
but really , we will not be doing it again .
but restaurants are n't just about food .
but sadly after this experience i do n't think i 'll be coming back .
but sadly i do n't think i will come back .
but sadly , i will not stay in the hotel here again .
but sadly , that 's not what i feel today .
but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
but security lines can be a nightmare .
but send your suicide note via cell phone ; their wifi sucks ass .
but seriously , take your kids .
but seriously , this place is great .
but seriously you have to check this place out !
but , she knows the current styles well .
but so far the place is a must eat !
but sorry to say this place is nothing special .
but spicy is always good in my book .
but staff is real good .
but stay , because the tapas are so good .
but still a beautiful room , good bang for the buck .
but , still always open at most times .
but still cool to take pictures outside .
but still love this place !
but still love this place every time regardless !
but still , the fish is fresh and yummy .
but still ... there are way better malls here in vegas .
but still well worth the trip off strip .
but super minor because of the service level .
butter crisp is a tasty appetizer .
buttermilk biscuits are yum , eggs perfect , potatoes are good .
but than again it 's cheap and you get what you pay for .
but thank god for this girl today !
but thank god i have a mind of my own .
but that is not the biggest problem .
but that is not the case .
but that 's another long story .
but that 's not the bad part .
but that 's not the worst part .
but that 's not why there are _num_ stars .
but that 's what you 'd expect from a biker bar !
but the airport is good .
but the bartenders are awesome and the service is great .
but the basics are so good .
but the beer and service are worth every penny .
but the beer is awesome too !
but the best part about this place is the atmosphere .
but the best thing is their flight attendants .
but the breakfast is my favorite there .
but , the casino and fast grub is great !
but the casino itself definitely leaves something to be desired .
but , the chicken smoker is solid , if not spectacular , airport food .
but the club is clean and well equipped .
but the customer service there is phenomenal .
but the desserts , which look great , are awful .
but the fact that i love oysters makes me come here .
- but the flavors are not right .
but , the food and brews are the best .
but the food and the atmosphere is well worth it .
but the food certainly is not worth the visit .
but the food , for the most part , is not .
but the food here is terrible .
but , the food is amazing .
but the food is amazing !
but the food is a must in fashion show mall .
but the food is consistently delicious !
but the food is delicious !
but the food is delicious and the drinks are strong .
but the food is good .
but the food is good worth the money i will return for more .
but the food is great .
but the food is nothing special .
but the food is pretty good and priced reasonably .
but the food is really not that great .
but the food is sooo damn good i have to come back .
but the food is still great .
but the food is still super delish !
but the food is worth it .
but the food 's damn good , cheap and totally worth the wait .
but the food still is worth it .
but , the friendly staff always makes meals more enjoyable .
but the furniture are very old .
but ... the good is good .
but the guide is well worth it .
but the hotel itself is not in the best shape .
but the hotel not so good not so clean .
but the hours are uncomfortable ( _num_ am - _num_ pm ) .
but , their customer service is lacking and so is their food .
but their food is worth it !
but , their happy hour is something worth checking out .
but their lemon pie is my favorite one .
but their management is not very good .
but their spare ribs are amazing !
but the key is that they do it right .
but the lake mead location is better .
but the main hotel is a little dirty and the pool is so so .
but the main point is the food - and circo delivers .
but the meat quality is below average .
but the menu does n't have a good selection .
but then again it is walmart .
but then again this is las vegas .
but then again , upgrades make the room price go up .
but then again , you are paying for location and view .
but , the negatives are plenty .
but the next day no one contacted us , we call them again .
but the next shop over the same items come to _num_ to _num_ dollars .
but the next trip , we 're definitely staying elsewhere .
but then something tells you to look down at the sheets and no .
but the pasta is amazing .
but the people at this store make it one worth going to .
but the pepper chicken is good .
but the pho is great .
but the pizza and price is top notch .
but the pizza is especially delicious , no matter what any one says .
but the place is huge and clean .
but the place is super cute .
but the price is what draws everyone to this place .
but , the prices are _num_ !
but the quality is good and the styles are hip .
but the quality of the food is superb .
but the real pleasure is the service department .
but the real real big complaint i have is they never have enough cashiers .
but there are other products worthy of purchasing too .
but there are still a bunch of shoe stores .
but there food is just not my type .
but there is a positive ... what happens in vegas stays in vegas !
but there 's a reason why the westin has some terrible reviews .
but there 's better places to spend your time in vegas .
but there 's no way i will ever send someone to this place .
but the respect level is not .
but the rest , is upsetting when think anymore about it .
but there wo n't be a next time .
but the ribs are great .
but the room is disgusting and not worth it .
but the rooms are clean and comfy .
but the rooms are tiny and the beds are not that great .
but the rooms make up for all of it .
but the room 's walls are too thin .
but the seasonal pumpkin pancakes are delicious .
but the server is not professional .
but the servers are good and friendly .
but the servers are not all that friendly .
but the service is even better .
but the service is horrible !
but the service is not about the customer .
but the service is terrible .
but the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre .
but the shoes are great !
but the staff is always awesome , and the place is immaculate .
but the staff is the best .
but the story does not end there .
but the ticket price is decent .
but the view and the service is worth every dollar !
but the wine list is superb and the food is unique .
but the wynn has a light and airy feel - i love it !
but they all taste as if nobody in the kitchen has taste buds .
but they are all pretty nice !
but they are certainly delicious .
but they are clean so i cant complain too much .
but they are not .
but , they are n't very many .
but they are pretty good about moving through the line .
but they are serving great food at awesome prices .
but they didnt care .
but they do n't know this .
but they either do n't or just do n't care .
but , they get one star because of the food .
but , they never bring our sauces .
but they offer pretty much every service your vehicle will need .
but they only mean if you 're in the lobby .
but ... they only serve those one night a week !
but they 're huge and fun to do with friends .
but they still insisted that i need to replace a/c with new parts .
but they sure ask a lot of money for the view .
but they usually take that off the price for customer satisfaction .
but they wo n't do it .
but this dessert wo n't change my review of nora 's .
but this does not compare to being scammed twice by the excalibur .
but this guy is nice to other people but not to me .
but this is a good option .
but this is a great airport considering it is vegas .
but this is my review , not his , so two it is .
but this is not high praise .
but this is n't about messing up my order this is much much worse .
but this is one of the better ones in town .
but this is ridiculous .
but this is vegas .
but this is vegas , with literally unlimited dining choices .
but this is very much not a social scene hangout .
but this lady , damn , she needs a hug or something .
but this leads me too the prices !
but this location has terrible costumer service .
but this location is the worst one !
but this location is very dirty .
but this one has the worst service !
but this one is very good .
but this one wins .
but this place can be pretty crowded but it is well worth it !
but this place deserves it .
but this place has a great happy hour on fridays .
but this place i love !
but this place is awesome and i will come back .
but this place is definitely a zero in my book .
but this place is growing out of its self needs a new spot asap !
but , this place just is n't clean .
but this place needs work ... same shit every time i go here .
but this property in las vegas is old , dirty and low class now .
, but this salad is outstanding .
but this tom 's has a problem .
but tina is amazing .
but todai in miracle shop - las vegas is unacceptable .
but to get a good park , you have to get here early !
but to make my order wrong and then try and charge me ?
but to me , it does not taste fresh at all .
but to my surprise they do n't want to remedy the situation .
but totally worth it if you do !
but to walk / cab here from the strip , nah ... probably not .
but unless you 're paying , i 'm not going back .
but wait it gets so much better !
but wait , what about the broth .
but we always eat in the diner .
but we are loyal and patient we love the staff and atmosphere .
but well she is ) orders something off of the lunch menu .
but well worth the trip .
but we notice not one difference in the room after that whole ordeal .
but we 're in the middle of the desert so i 'll round up .
but we will never return for dinner .
but we will not be coming here anymore .
but we will not go back anytime soon .
but what a treat .
but what do you know it fails yet again .
but what i can rate is the layout and the flowers and the staff .
but whats the point if they never get back to you .
but what they do at spinato 's , they do so , so right .
but when i do its a mess .
but when in need a food _num_ hour fat burger is worth it .
but when it is , bring it !
but when you actually watch them make the drink you can see why .
but whoever he is , god bless his heart .
but who knows , perhaps it 's delicious .
but why is it so damn cold at night during the summer !
but why pay good money and resort fees for a motel quality room ?
but will help you repair your auto correctly .
but will not be going back .
but will not go back .
but will not go back and will not recommend the place .
but will stop by because i tend to use them for their parking .
but with all the great restaurants in vegas there are better options .
but without even that , the food just is n't good .
but with plenty of other cheap drink dive bars near the strip .
but worth the drive from any side of town .
but worth the wait .
but yeah , this place is going downhill and fast .
but yea i love this damn hotel !
but yelp , you are wrong .
but you can get a room for $ _num_ sometimes !
but you ca n't get a piece of freaking italian bread .
but , you get a good deal for the $ you pay !
but you get way more than you 'd expect with such a great price .
but you get what you pay for ... not much .
but , you know what , as an airport it is pretty decent .
but your child will remember it for a lifetime .
but you 're awesome whoever you are .
but you serve one helluva good burger .
buy a drink and pour some extra vodka on the top .
buy a drink or get the hell out !
buying pants from here is less reliable than goodwill .
buy _num_ get the 10th boba drink free .
buy one get one free from hotel and i am a happy camper .
buy one get one is a waste of your money .
by all means , do not eat here .
by all means , take my money so i can vacation at this dump !
by far for me , this is the best pizza around .
by far i must say one of the best airports in the country !
by far it is my favorite pool hall in town .

by now , we 're frustrated and just pay the bill .
by such system this place is barely better than mcdonald 's .
by the book , and service with a smile .
by the ron is awesome .
by the time it comes in , i will not need it any longer !
by the time it gets to your floor they are already full .
by the way ask for juan the waiter he 's the best !
( by the way , calling this place `` all suites '' is misleading .
by the way their pool is outstanding even when it 's cold outside .
by the way , the rolls are amazing !
by the way the room service stops at 11:00 pm and the menu sucks !
by the way , this is 11pm on a thursday .
by the way , why does everyone ask `` what for ?
by the way , your outfits are suck .
cabana suites are really nice .
cab fare from the hotel sucks too .
cab ride over from the strip under $ _num_ so worth it .

thank you yelp !
thank you yelp and smart phones !
thank you yelp for another great recommendation .
thank you yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy gammage .
that 2nd guy is the only reason this is a _num_ star review .
that all you can drink menu though , is worth coming here !
that alone gives it at least _num_ stars .
that alone gives them _num_ stars !
that alone makes it great in my book !
that alone shows an owner that cares !
that and the sewer smell = never coming back .
that aside , i do really enjoy brewery itself .
that back drop makes for an amazing dinning experience .
that bar is disgusting !
that beats our family staple of three per meal .
that comes out to $ _num_ .
that concept just does n't work for me .
that dish alone is worth the five stars !
that does n't even remotely make sense .
that does n't include the price of printing a boarding pass ?
that does n't include the wait standing in line to check in .
that does n't mean they wo n't be delicious !
that explains the piss smell that everybody on here is mentioning in their reviews .
that extra tlc is very nice .
that freaked me out that they are just holding all that food !
that goes to show their still misleading customers .
that guy is just incredible !
that gym team is horrible !
that have two sides of barbers and everyone cuts good !
that hits it out of the park for me !
that hotel is magnificent at night .
that includes our kids older cars and our newer cars .
that in itself makes this airport annoying enough .
that is a basic thing to have , not a luxury .
that is about as bad as it gets .
that is actually false , apart from the eating with your hands part .
that is all and that makes me a fan .
that is always a good start when walking to places like this .
that is amazing !
that is a $ _num_ product .
that is a poor business model .
that is a winner on it 's own !
that is a woman who has a rich life and knows what is important !
that is customer service !
that is customer service at it 's best .
that is false advertising !
that is good business !
that is horrible .
that is how good the food is here .
that is how i describe this place .
that is important to me .
that is its only redeeming quality .
that is just a personal preference for me .
that is just flat out nuts .
that is just strange .
that is no excuse .
that is not authentic .
that is not easy here .
that is not enough .
that is not ok !
that is not really a bread bowl .
that is not the case .
that is not their problem .
that is not the way you treat customers .
that is not true !
that is no way to treat a customer !
that is n't an option on my mac .
that is poor .
that is pretty careless .
that is pretty damn impressive !
that is probably the only good thing about this place .
that is rare these days .
that is restaurant _num_ .
that is ridiculous !
that is ridiculous .
that is service !
that is simply unacceptable !
that is some damn fine beef !
that is something you never see anymore because that is real customer service .
that is so ridiculous !
that is so wrong .
that is terrible all i hear is the band outside .
that is terrible customer service .
that is the absolute worst part of the whole ordeal for me .
that is the highest praise i can give , really .
that is the honest truth !
that is the # _num_ reason that this airport is the best !
that is the only good part of our entire time at this place .
that is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .
that is the way to treat a customer and keep a customer .
that is totally a bs rule .
that is true , but the location is just fine .
that is unacceptable behavior to a guest .
that is where any positives end .
that is worth a trip .
that just kills me every time i see it .
that just seems like a sin .
that kinda stuff works to create loyalty .
that late at night and no reservations , one ca n't be picky .
- that late night drive across the desert .
that leaves you no excuse .
that 'll be $ _num_ for ten minutes on the internet please .
that 'll teach me for trying to patronize `` the little guy '' .
that makes a start to for a fun day .
that makes me a fan !
that makes me happy .
that makes me happy on the inside !
that makes no sense whatsoever .
that may be the america in me but they are sooooo delicious !
that meal is worth it .
that means a lot of very long lines and cranky staff members .
that means i also know what bad to excellent service is .
that means she does n't care about my business .
that _num_ minute drive there and back is n't so bad !
that _num_ star is for hospitality .
that one sucks .
that or maybe just be nice instead .
that or sexy ways , it depends .
that place is a poor excuse of a resort .
that place is great but way over priced .
that place seems to be so busy .
that plus a _num_ minute wait with reservations .
that process dragged out too long .
that really annoying in vegas because people come and go at all hours .
that really sucks .
that requires light to medium roast and fresh beans .
that right off the bat is a negative star .
that 's a big one in my book !
that 's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink .
that 's about as good as it gets for modern air travel .
that 's a damn good deal .
that 's a different terminal but ok , here we go .
that 's a huge plus in my book !
that 's a lie .
that 's all it takes for me !
that 's all that stands out to me .
that 's always a win win .
that 's a $ _num_ increase and another lie .
that 's a pretty good saves right there .
that 's as good as it gets , awesome , i love it .
that 's a small thing though ... overall best place to go !
that sauce they are cooked in is absolutely amazing .
thats a win in my book already !
that 's careless work - unacceptable .
that 's completely missing the point .
that seems to be a mission critical function at a car wash .
thats fine but it is way over crowded and gross .
that 's going that extra mile if you ask me !
that 's hard to do because i like salty fries .
thats how bad this hotel is .
that 's how bad this place is .

that 's important to know !
that 's is in top of the $ _num_ charge .
that 's just good customer service and a great way to do business .
that 's like no big mac at mcdonald 's !
that 's nice when coming from the tempe campus in the heat !
that 's not how you treat potential customers .
that 's not the point .
that 's not to say that it 's bad .
that 's not to say that this place is n't deserving of any stars .
that 's not what you want when you go to a buffet .
that 's no way to spend your vacation time .
that 's _num_ minutes on a slow night .
that something right is their wood grill that perfectly cooks your burger to order .
that sounds amazing right after a long night of partying !
that 's perfect cause kids get sick unexpectedly .
that 's pretty impressive for any pizza place if you ask me .
that 's really not acceptable at a high end steakhouse .
that 's right - all you can drink wine comes with the meals !
that 's right , most ink has animal products in it !
that 's something the riviera needs to work on and stop ignoring .
that staff is always friendly .
that 's the best , top it off with spices they have !
that 's the customer service we love !
thats the history of nevada that is worthy of being history at this time .
that 's the only excuse you have for going to this place .
that 's the only reason i am not giving one star .
that 's the only way to describe it .
that 's the problem with chains - quality is n't there .
thats the reason it doesnt get _num_ the food is good .
that 's the selling point , it is cheap .
that 's the vibe i get !
that 's the winning combination that keeps me coming back .
that 's to keep the toppings from burning but it 's good .
that sucks .
that 's what i call excellent service .
that 's what i get for trying to save money on a oil change .
that 's what the manager is saying and all of it pretty rude .
thats what the vegas monorail is like to me ... without being so funny .
that 's where it stops .
that 's where the good stuff ends , though .
thats why i and my work company love coming here .
that 's why i eat here i love the foods authentic quality .
that 's why i love the nugget .
thats why i love this place .
that 's why i prefer a holiday inn express that actually appreciates my business .
that 's why i think its shady .
that 's why they get the 2nd star .
that 's your own damn problem , not mine .
that 's your response when it is plain to see they are n't fresh ?
that tells you a lot about a place .
that turtle cheesecake is superb !
that way , the pho is perfectly fresh when you combine everything .
that will not last , though .
