business must be good or they would not treat patients this way .
business _num_ class might help his lady .
but , after much consultation , they decided on _num_ % off .
but a good track to run on , no doubt about that .
but alas , even here the restaurant i loved the most was sorely disappointing .
but , alas , no such luck if the dining area is closed !
but all and all it was a great time .
but all in all , wasn't a deal breaker .
but all together we were satisfied !
but also the experience that made the whole process a time we'll remember .
but , as for security , it was a bit sketchy .
but a stroll around the hotel gardens after dinner was quite nice .
but as we were being seated , we noticed the restaurant was almost empty .
but as you might assume , it was a huge problem !
but a true old time parlor should have french fries .
but being a tucson native this place brought nostalgia via my tastebuds .
but besides that , i am very pleased !
but between the _num_ orders for dinner , we had issues with all _num_ .
but both were mediocre .
but cool fountain and we enjoyed dining in the courtyard under the pretty lights !
but could only get one _num_ weeks out .
but decent breakfast , charming property ... and a unique experience i'd say .
but definitely not worth it for old coffee and stale probably store bought tiramisu .
but , didn't want to start all over at another store .
but dishes were very well prepared .
but don't expect free crushed peppers they charge a extra cost .
but don't try this at home ... i am a trained professional !
but everything tasted great and the service was quick and friendly .
but everything was so tasty .
but , for $ _num_ an entree' i expected something better .
but for $ _num_ they could tear the transmission apart and let me know .
but for the prices i would definitely go someplace else .
but fortunately , the staff took care of that quickly .
but from speaking with them on the phone they were very friendly and helpful !
but fuck , they should probably be out of business .
but haven't yet complained .
but he did a great job so it was worth it .
but he didn't say we were done .
but he wasn't worth another minute of my life .
but his off night may have cost lon's a few new customers .
but i am done .
but i am not impressed with what it is becoming .
but i brushed it off and gave them another chance .
but , i called midas and they were so great .
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
but i'd definitely recommend jonathan to anyone !
but i did find large pieces of lettuce under the tacos in the basket .
but i did find the perfect `` pretty white bra .''
but i did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite .
but i didn't even get a smile , or even eye contact .
but i don't buy that it was a fluke .
but i'd rather drive or go elsewhere , emergency or not .
but i even said sorry for getting in her way .
but if it was , it was watered down with sour cream .
but i got ta tell you that i am very disappointed in them .
but i have given it several tries and i just can't recommend it .
but i have never been treated like that before as a guest .
but i have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant .
but i loved it , loved it and my so loved it too .
but i'm not even done yet .
but i'm very pleased with my shoes and bag .
but in my opinion there should be no wrong items on a menu .
but instead , i repeated my order to her .
but in the mean time , they would not give me my car .
but i really hate when i leave a place feeling used & played .
but i recently passed it today and remembered how great this place is .
but i still enjoyed viewing others' unique perspective on life and art .
but it did all taste great ( the sodium definitely played a part ) .
but it had a very long way to go in that respect .
but i think i have expressed enough with what i have shared so far .
but it looked nothing like the flower on my fingers .
but it mostly disappeared , so it must of been okay .
but it started out rocky doesn't mean anything because it stayed rocky !
but it's totally a hidden gem !
but it was better than mine !
but it was dead in there .
but it was delicious !
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
but it was not great food either .
but it wasn't , and i wasn't .
but it was totally worth it .
but it was wonderful .
but it was worth it .
but , i've been going there for years and years and years .
but i've been on vacation here in arizona since june .
but i was grateful and left it at that .
but i was left alone for _num_ minutes .
but i was not impressed by the hh specials or the food .
but i wasn't going to be rude .
but i was overall very disappointed in the food .
but , i was with my children on a school night .
but i would not come here again .
but i wouldn't venture back there again .
but i would rather eat at ihop than this place .
but like the garlic knots , the dough itself offered very little flavor .
but , loved it !
but maybe the main courses of red curry and pad thai would be great .
but michael , the manager , is what won us over .
but my color and cut always looks great .
but my experience at this particular store was just terrible .
but my experience was awful .
but my order was completely wrong and not complete .
but my point is that there was attitude and we we're treated poorly .
but my stay actually went quite smooth .
but never the less , the burger was still delicious as ever !
but ... no , i decided why not see how their other food is .
but no , i think they truly earned a _num_ .
but nonetheless , the edamame and the sake bombs were perfection as always .
but none was delivered .
but no one ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers .
but no one seemed to care that much , was on my own .
but nothing happened .
but nothing i'd rave about .
but now they get very defensive and say he didn't miss anything .
but $ _num_ for a tiny little portion was irritating .
but once i found it .
but one we got food , the pizza was impressive .
but only because i wanted the vehicle and payments were decent .
but other than that i really liked this place and their food and service .
but other than that it was great .
but other than that , i would definitely recommend this place !
but our most recent visit was very poor .
but our portions were quite small and the dishes overpriced .
but our requests for water and bread were so delayed .
but our service was the worst i have ever had .
but overall , great restaurant and i'd definitely go back !
but overall , i've always loved my experiences at the sugar bowl .
but overall i was impressed with charleston's and will probably be back .
but overall my experience was great .
but overall the experience and environment and service was great .
but overall the food was not memorable or worth the drive .
but overall they were good people !
but sadly , this is was the only positive for the restaurant .
but seriously i left bleeding the last time .
but she gave me the push i needed to find something better .
but she has not done a thing .
but she just , uh ... it was really weird .
but she said no .
but she was not nice about it .
but she will run off half the wonderful employees and all the regular customers .
but since we had an expectations , unfortunately the experience fell way short .
but since your here you might as well look around .
but some apology with some ownership would have been nice .
but somehow , the partying continued - as did our lack of sleep .
but something was definitely off .
but still for _num_ bucks i think it should fill me up .
but that didn't happen since the kitchen is closed .
but that is okay with me she was rude to begin with anyways .
but that no one would help me get the fabric .
but that's just it - it didn't blow me away .
but that was it ; nothing more after that but disappointment .
but that was my fault .
but that was nothing compared to the haircut .
but that was probably the only plus !
but that was the worst decision i could ever make .
but the atmosphere inside was very sad .
but the attitude of the girl on the phone was extremely rude .
but the bartender was great , offered personalized service .
but the complete opposite of light and fluffy like they should be .
but the crowd was really friendly !
, but the curry itself was a disaster .
but the customer service and pizza were better than most .
but the fact that it was frozen makes me skeptical on going back again .
but the food and service was excellent .

i suggest going elsewhere if you feel like being treated as a paying patron !
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
i sure didn't but wow , these people were fantastic !
i sure didn't get that vibe .
i suspect it was reheated .
i swear i used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots .
i switched to advanced auto on mcdowell and it is much better .
it actually was one of the worst mixed drinks i've ever had .
i talked very clearly i just one year and she said she understood .
it all went downhill from there .
it also had a tomato but instead of a nice red slice of tomato .
it also had the perfect mix of family , joy and happiness .
it also tasted bland .
it also tasted like cardboard , the finest cardboard in tempe .
it also was old and crusty hard .
it also was supposed to include a cut .
it also worked out nicely being so close to our house .
it anyways has been there on weekends .
it appears the old management has left and started a different restaurant elsewhere .
it being around _num_ or 6pm , the place was utterly packed .
it came as a combo with rice , fried wontons and an egg roll .
it came back better than new !
it came out great and for a great price .
it came out piping hot in a dish and was incredible .
it came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it .

it came out with less than a cup of pasta and no veggies .
it came with many sides and even included a cinnamon tea at the end .
it came with rice , crab puff and an egg roll .
it came with two generous scoops of rice and a few fried wonton .
it can get pretty packed at night .
it can get really packed on weekends .
it caused $ _num_ in damage .
it certainly can not be found at the salt cellar .
it certainly isn't worth eating here considering the quality of food and cost .
it certainly wasn't for patient care or respect .
it clearly was not the vegetable pizza i was expecting .
it completely made up for the meal .
it cost me an extra $ _num_ for the gel french manicure .
it could be any lame bar in any lame city .
it could b mold infested as we speak !
it could have been any family restaurant in a strip mall .
it could have been cooked for a few hours longer .
it could not accommodate our family of five .
it could've been great , but it was nowhere near good .
it did .
it did come with tzatziki sauce but , i've had better .
it did not come sizzling and the onions on the side were cold .
it did not taste fresh .
it did not taste fresh or sweet .
it did not taste like any other thai tom yum soup .
it did not work well together at all .
it didn't come out until the rest of our food .
it didn't even fill me up .
it didn't even smell good like a bakery should .
it didn't fall apart , it wasn't dry ; it was impeccable .
it didn't get finished .
it didn't have a lot of flavor and not enough toppings .
it didn't make any sense but walked away without more explanation .
it didn't make me sick , so i suppose that's a positive .
it didn't matter of she is good at all other times .
it didn't matter , though .
it didn't reflect your business values .
it didn't seem that bad when we walked onto the patio .
it didn't seem very professional .
it does not mean you should roll your eyes at them .
i tell them my situation and instantly they asked if i came from midas .
it ended up costing $ _num_ for _num_ people .
it ended up taking at least _num_ minutes .
it feels like the owners have given up .
it felt chaotic and rushed .
it felt like they were trying to hurry us out of the restaurant .
it felt like too much wasted time .
it felt nice to walk into a dive bar to watch the show .
it folded over , and made an even worse left over .
it gets pretty busy in the afternoon so we left around 3pm .
it got crowded , all the other patrons looked real happy too .
it got really busy here , i am sorry'' .
it got to me way faster !
it grew out , but did not chip and still looked really good .
it had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was so good .
it had a fishy taste , which was awkward and didn't smell pleasant .
it had a good garlic and spice combination .
it had a lot of good flavors going on and was cooked well .
it had a nice crowd .
it had a pile of bacon in it and it sure was tasty .
it had a tuna taste and just not cooked here kinda vibe .
it had big chunks of shaved parmesan in it which was cool .
it had big potential but working together wound up being extremely disappointing .
it had complex layers of flavor and was cooked properly .
it had goat cheese , chicken and all the fixings .
it had no flavor or very little sauce .
it had the perfect combinations of flavors and was made with delicious fresh cheeses .
it had zero flavor period .
i thanked him and walked away .
it has a lot to offer compared to just a regular restaurant .
it has always had an eclectic mix of items .
it has become my favorite place for tilapia or steak .
